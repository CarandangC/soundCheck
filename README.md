# **SoundCheck** 

SoundCheck is an online ticket purchasing system that allows consumers to purchase concert tickets via a website. The user will be able to view concerts they bought all in one place. In order for customers to access events and purchase tickets they must register and login in order to be granted access to such features. At each process such as registering, logging in and purchasing tickets, a verification process has been put into place to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
